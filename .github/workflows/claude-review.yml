            Focus on WeGo-specific security concerns:

            **Firebase/Firestore Security:**
            - Firestore security rules properly restrict access
            - No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
            - Auth guards on all protected routes
            - Owner-based access control for vehicle finance data

            **Authentication & Authorization:**
            - JWT token handling
            - Password hashing (bcrypt/passlib)
            - Session management
            - Role-based access control (UserRole enum)

            **Data Validation:**
            - Zod schemas at API boundaries
            - Input sanitization
            - No SQL/NoSQL injection vectors
            - XSS prevention in React components

            **Secrets & Configuration:**
            - No hardcoded API keys or secrets
            - Environment variables properly used
            - Firebase config not exposing sensitive data

            **Payment & Financial Data:**
            - Vehicle finance data properly protected
            - Transaction handling secure
            - Commission calculations validated
